# DrawInstance

This Unity Package is a template for using DrawInstanceProcedural to draw hundreds of thousands (and more) objects in Unity.  
It leans heavily on learnings from [Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) to create the HLSL shader code that plays
nicely with URP ShaderGraphs and Unity's Instancing system.
